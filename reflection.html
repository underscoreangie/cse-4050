        <p style="color: rgb(133, 16, 16); font-size:x-large; font-weight: bold;">This class has taught me a lot about
            web development. I learned about HTML, some JavaScript, and some API. I was able to expand on some
            assignments and learned how
            center pictures and text as well! Obviously I am still not an expert in these languages, but I have the
            basics and now I can expand on them when I go to other classes or work on my own projects. <br><br> This
            class helped immensely and I'm so excited to see what I can do in the future with what I learned in this
            class! </p>
