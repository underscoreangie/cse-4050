            <p>Hello! I am Angelica Gutierrez, a fourth year Computer Systems - Graphics Programming major and Graphic
                Design
                Web minor! <br><br>This is will I will display my assignments of what I've learned in this class while
                also
                expanding by
                researching
                topics. I will put everything here so I have everything in one place. I will show this by creating a
                small
                website prototype with my assignments that I created and by experimenting with things I find online.
                <br><br>I
                would like to work in web development after graduation so this will help me immensely to get some
                experience with experimenting with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and whatever else I come across! </p>
